        "Here is a scenario:"
        "Housing Cooperation Woonstad Rotterdam implemented a camera system throughout their properties. However, now they are planning to implement facial recognition. Some residents have concerns about privacy and constant monitoring."
        "Woonstad Rotterdam justifies this by referring to the increase in local robberies, believing the system will enhance safety and aid police in solving crimes."
        "Residents argue that the system infringes on their privacy and freedom. They are uncertain about the data usage and sharing with third parties."
        "Woonstad Rotterdam assures that images will only be analyzed in case of crimes and are solely for safety purposes."
        "Should the facial recognition system be used? Consider the stakeholders, their positions, and ethical ramifications. Values at play include privacy, safety, freedom, and societal wellbeing. Moral dilemmas and risks are also present, such as privacy vs. safety and perception of safety vs. privacy."
